To compile:

gcc bbfs.c -o bbfs \`pkg-config fuse --cflags --libs\`

```
cd test
../bbfs rootdir/ mountdir/
```
After this, you should be able to do normal operations on files inside of mountdir, but reads and writes should take 3 seconds due to delay. We can modify this with a for loop if necessary instead of a sleep.

To undo, `fusermount -u mountdir`
